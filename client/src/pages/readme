Purpose of the pages Folder
The pages folder typically contains all the components that represent the application's routes or views. Each file in this folder corresponds to a specific page or route in your application.

Key Functions:
Route Mapping:

Each file within pages maps to a URL route (e.g., Home.jsx maps to /home).
Subfolders represent nested routes (e.g., pages/admin/Dashboard.jsx maps to /admin/dashboard).
Page-Level Logic:

Pages serve as containers for route-specific logic.
They import and use components, hooks, and utilities to display the appropriate UI.
Integration Point:

The pages folder acts as an integration layer, combining layouts and components to create a complete user-facing interface.
